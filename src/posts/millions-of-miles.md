I think I've done it.

I've crossed boundless mountains;  
Submerged the deepest seas.

I kept hearing what it's like:  
Where others come from;  
From whom they've seen.

I've heard the languished voices,  
And felt the cool in the breeze.

I've held the notion of enduring seas;  
On the course of millions of miles;  
Just a small spec upon the saturated hills.

But now I think I've done it.

By crossing the veiled curtain,  
With specs of light touching my face,  
And the mountains of warmth joining my hands.
