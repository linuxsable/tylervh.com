# How to Drive a Developer Crazy

1. Ignore all syntax and whitespace conventions, invent your own instead.
2. Commit code without reviewing your own diffs for errors and consistency.
3. Commit code to source control with meaningless messages.
4. Use meaningless names for variables, functions, classes, etc., that only mean something to you.
5. Create large functions which take up many, many lines of code, possibly even pages.
6. Don't use project libraries or components, but invent your own to keep things un-DRY and inconsistent as possible.
