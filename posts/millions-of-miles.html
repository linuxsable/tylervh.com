<h1>Millions of Miles</h1>
<time>2017-01-01</time>

<p>I think I've done it.</p>

<p>
  I've crossed boundless mountains;<br />
  Submerged the deepest seas.
</p>

<p>
  I kept hearing what it's like:<br />
  Where others come from;<br />
  From whom they've seen.
</p>

<p>
  I've heard the languished voices,<br />
  And felt the cool in the breeze.
</p>

<p>
  I've held the notion of enduring seas;<br />
  On the course of millions of miles;<br />
  Just a small spec upon the saturated hills.
</p>

<p>But now I think I've done it.</p>

<p>
  By crossing the veiled curtain,<br />
  With specs of light touching my face,<br />
  And the mountains of warmth joining my hands.
</p>
