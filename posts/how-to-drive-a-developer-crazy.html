<ul>
  <li>Ignore all syntax and whitespace conventions, invent your own instead.</li>
  <li>Commit code without reviewing your own diffs for errors and consistency.</li>
  <li>Commit code to source control with meaningless messages.</li>
  <li>Use meaningless names for variables, functions, classes, etc., that only mean something to you.</li>
  <li>Create large functions which take up many, many lines of code, possibly even pages.</li>
  <li>Don't use project libraries or components, but invent your own to keep things un-DRY and inconsistent as possible.</li>
</ul>
